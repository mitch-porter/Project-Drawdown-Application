Hello - Thanks for viewing my application for Geospatial Analyst at Project Drawdown! All the work I have done for the past 8 months is Classified and the work before that is proprietary, so unfortunately I am unable to share code related to past work experiences. However, I had a blast working on this Jupyter notebook and feel it does a better job of representing my current skillset than code examples from over a year ago could anyway. 

The Notebook utilizes Google Earth Engine and interactive packages to downscale MODIS LST imagery from 1000m to 10m using Sentinel-2 NDVI imagery and linear regression. I chose this specific downscaling to demonstrate I meet the qualifications and skills of the 'ideal candidate', as outlined in the job posting.

Thanks again for viewing my application and taking the time to explore my tool - I hope to discuss it with you in the near future!
